# readysetboole
An introduction to boolean algebra and set theory, through exercises implemented in a functional language (I chose ocaml).
You can find the main.ml file with tests in the bin folder, and the exercises are in the lib folder.

# Learning
This project serves multiple purposes for me.
1. Learning ocaml
2. Understanding boolean algebra, bitwise operations, logic. Things I've always faded, and am now trying to grasp fully.
3. Discovering set theory.

## Ressources I found on the way, some useful, some just interesting
- adder and multiplier
    - doing module 00 and 01 of nand2tetris.org helped me get an intuition for how logic gates work, and easily understand how to do addition with only boolean operators
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_multiplier
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation
- ocaml. Not easy to learn when coming from imperative and OOP. Also just lots of quite curious syntax/design decisions, but it has a strong toolkit, big community and plenty ressources. And it's fast like c, and compiles to elf, and has a pretty REPL
    - [This course by Cornell](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook) is pretty good, I would start there and complement with the tutorials/guides/pages on ocaml.org.
    - Start coding simple stuff in the REPL, you can do these [exercises](https://ocaml.org/exercises) and then go hunt for the syntax you need

- [ ] add more, remove unecessary words
